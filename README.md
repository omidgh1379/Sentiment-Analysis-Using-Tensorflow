# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Tensorflow
This notebook trains a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text of the review. This is an example of binary—or two-class—classification, an important and widely applicable kind of machine learning problem.  You'll use the Large Movie Review Dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are balanced, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
